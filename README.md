# Weather App Front End

## Description

In this project, I build the front-end weather app. A User can input a city and state, and they can search to find the current weather followed by the next 5 days.

## Available Scripts

Note: this project also has a backend component, please run these components on separate ports.

I recommend running the front-end on `PORT=4000` and backend on `PORT=3000`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## Environmental variables 

To copy environmental variables to the template please do the following:

`cp .env.template .env.local`
REACT_APP_WEATHER_APP_URL= "url of the weather app backend"
PORT= "the port you are running the app on"
